#  Real-Time American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition using CNNs
> A high-accuracy, real-time ASL recognition system powered by TensorFlow and OpenCV.

---

##  Overview

This project implements a **real-time ASL recognition system** that translates static hand gestures (Aâ€“Z) into text. The system is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and is capable of smooth real-time prediction on standard hardware with a test accuracy of **98.77%**.
